# Toxic-Comment-Classification
Completed this project as an independent Data Science initiative.
Key highlights:

•Addressed the challenge of detecting and filtering toxic comments on social
platforms to maintain healthy discussions.

•Preprocessed text data through cleaning, normalization, and vectorization
using TF-IDF.

•Built a Logistic Regression-based classification model to predict comment
toxicity.

•Developed a GUI using Tkinter for real-time predictions, allowing users to
input comments and receive instant results.
